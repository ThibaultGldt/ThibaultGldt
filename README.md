- 👋 I’m Thibault, a junior web developer. I just finished a bachelor's degree in Web Applications which was a work/study training program, during my intership at the Voreppe's townhall I built web applications with Symfony to help the people working there gaining some time with their redundant tasks.
- 👀 I’m interested in all technologies used for back-end developement but mainly Symfony, NodeJS and a bit Rust. Though what I like the most about back-end dev is to learn the different types of stuctures that we can use to build an application
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Symfony 5 and TypeScript.
- 🔍 I’m looking for a junior back-end of full-stack developer job that would allow me to improve and to gain experience
